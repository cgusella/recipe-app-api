When a docker file is created, this need to be name starting with a capital D and without any extension.

The command 'MKDIR /app' create a folder in the image, and the command 'COPY ./app /app'
copies the contenets of the ./app, folder in the local machine, to the /app folder in the image.

The -D in Dockerfile[10] means that user is going to be used in running applications only.
This is done for security reasons.

Docke-compose[9]:  'volume' allows you to transfer in real time changes made in the docker folder directly in the
docker image. You don't need to restart the docker to see the changes.
